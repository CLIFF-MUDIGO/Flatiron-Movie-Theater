Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deliverables
As a user, I can:

1. See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of
   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of
   `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET
   request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

   
   GET /films/1

   Example Response:
   {
     "id": "1",
     "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
     "runtime": "108",
     "capacity": 30,
     "showtime": "04:00PM",
     "tickets_sold": 27,
     "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
     "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
   }
 
2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films`
   element when the page loads. (_optional_: you can style each film in the list
   by adding the classes `film item` to each `li` element.) There is a
   placeholder `li` in the `ul#films` element that is hardcoded in the HTML â€”
   feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use
   JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list. You
   will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the
   film data:


   GET /films

   Example response:
   [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
        "runtime": "108",
        "capacity": 30,
        "showtime": "04:00PM",
        "tickets_sold": 27,
        "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
      },
      {
        "id": "2",
        "title": "Manos: The Hands Of Fate",
        "runtime": "118",
        "capacity": 50,
        "showtime": "06:45PM",
        "tickets_sold": 44,
        "description": "A family gets lost on the road and stumbles upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master and his servant Torgo.",
        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/47781/p47781_v_v8_ac.jpg"
      }
